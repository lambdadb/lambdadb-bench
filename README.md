# lambdadb-bench

Reproducible benchmark harness for LambdaDB and comparable managed vector
databases.

The initial benchmark design focuses on the Cohere Wikipedia embedding workload
used by `tpuf-benchmark`, with LambdaDB, Qdrant Cloud, and Pinecone Serverless as
the first target adapters.

See [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the current design decisions, workload
model, adapter contract, result format, and implementation phases.
